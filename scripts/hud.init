# hud.init
# --------
#
# This script does noting more than start hud.
# This is a work around for a nasty problem with
# SSEClient/requests. The problem was that the 
# requests with 'stream=True' would'nt initialize
# when hud is run directly from systemd.
#
# For some weird reason running hud from this bash
# 'wrapper' fixes the annoyance.
