It's main purpose is to be able to control\r\nhome-assistant from a pi with a touchscreen mounted on the wall.\r\n\r\nThis project uses [pygame](http://pygame.org) as backed & the awesome\r\n[pgu](https://github.com/parogers/pgu) for the GUI. Using a custom theme\r\n& UI elements, I've tried to mimmick the web ui of home-assistant.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n![screencast](https://github.com/subutux/HUD/raw/master/images/screencast.gif)\r\n\r\n## features\r\n* displaying group items\r\n* switching on/off of lights\r\n* displaying sensor data\r\n* Uses EventStream (`/api/stream`) for streaming updates\r\n* Using `icon_font_to_png` to use the Material Design Icon font on the fly.\r\n* Cool\r\n\r\n## Install instructions\r\n### Home Assistant\r\n\r\nYes, you'll need to install Home Assistant. Don't worry you don't have to run it! We need it for its remote & core class.\r\nJust do:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install homeassistant\r\n```\r\n\r\n### pygame on python3\r\n\r\nCurrently, to my knownledge, there are no known packages pygame on python3\r\n\r\nYou'll have to compile pygame(1.9.2) from source. Luckly, this isn't that hard.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# install these packages for ubuntu/debian\r\nsudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev python-numpy subversion  libportmidi-dev\r\n# clone using mercury\r\nhg clone https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame\r\ncd pygame\r\npip3 install .\r\n```\r\n\r\n### pgu on python3\r\n\r\nSee above, install from source\r\n```bash\r\n# get the source from github\r\ngit clone https://github.com/parogers/pgu\r\ncd pgu\r\npip3 install .\r\n```\r\n\r\n### HUD\r\nplace it somewhere. Execute hud.py & enjoy!\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nHUD needs a configuration file, ini-style. For Example:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[HomeAssistant]\r\nHost = localhost\r\nPort = 8123\r\nKey = my-secret-password\r\nSSL = False\r\n[lights]\r\ngroup=lichten_living\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first one speaks for itself, home assistant configuration.\r\n\r\nThe second one is a group definition. it needs an group entity name\r\n(for ex. if you have `group.lichten_living` enter `lichten_living`)\r\nThere can be as many sections as you want, if you have at least one\r\nHomeAssistant section.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n## Disclamer\r\n\r\nDon't look at the code, it's ugly! You're always welcome to post a pull request to make the code cleaner, or just give me some pointers. I love to learn more!",
